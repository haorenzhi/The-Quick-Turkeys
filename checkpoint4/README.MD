4_2 Are there differences in the properties of the graphs of officers who are co-offenders, as compared to the expected officer deployment patterns?

Open checkpoint4_2.gephi in Gephi and you will see the graph of officers assigned in same beats.

Code using sequence for reproducing: checkpoint4_2_1.sql, checkpoint4_2_2.py, checkpoint4_2_3.sql, gremlincode_4_2.txt.
