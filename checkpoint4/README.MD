4_1 Are there clusters of officers that account for a large amount of TRRs?

Open checkpoint4_1.gephi in Gephi to see the graph of officers that have shared trrs

Code to reproduce: checkpoint 4_1_1.sql, checkpoint 4_1_2.py, germlin_code_4_1.txt.

4_2 Are there differences in the properties of the graphs of officers who are co-offenders, as compared to the expected officer deployment patterns?

Open checkpoint4_2.gephi in Gephi and you will see the graph of officers assigned in same beats.

Code using sequence for reproducing: checkpoint4_2_1.sql, checkpoint4_2_2.py, checkpoint4_2_3.sql, gremlincode_4_2.txt.

For both of these you may have to change the path in the python and gremlin files.
